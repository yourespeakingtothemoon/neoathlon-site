# Introduction

Hello! Welcome to the online manual for Neoathlon! This game started as a 10 week long student project and is becoming something a bit better, hopefully you can join me on this journey to make a new and modern racing experience.

## The Year is 3029...

...you find yourself in a grand stadium crowded with spectators. The air is thick with anticipation as a cavalcade of lights dance across the colossal brass structures that encircle the arena. The engines roar to life, in union with the collective heartbeat of the crowd. The vehicles with a light hum pop up off the metallic floor, defying gravity. Welcome to The Neoathlon, where the legacy of human ingenuity becomes a galactic sport. Prepare to race through time, challenge the cosmos, and etch your name in the annals of racing history. Gear up, pilots, for the ride of a lifetime awaits!
